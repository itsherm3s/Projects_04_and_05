# Sorted Linked List & Sorted Stack

## Overview
This project contains two Java programs:
1. **SortedLinkedList**: A Java implementation of a sorted linked list that organizes elements in ascending order.
2. **SortedStack**: A Java implementation of a stack that stores elements in sorted order (smallest to largest).

## Files
- **SortedLinkedList.java**: Implements a sorted linked list where elements are automatically placed in order.
- **SortedStack.java**: Implements a stack with elements sorted in ascending order.

## Features
### SortedLinkedList.java
- Automatically maintains the order of elements in ascending order as they are inserted.
- Supports standard operations such as inserting, removing, and traversing the list.

### SortedStack.java
- Implements a stack (LIFO structure) where elements are pushed in sorted order.
- Ensures that elements remain sorted after every push operation.
- Supports basic stack operations like push, pop, and peek, while maintaining the order of elements.

## Compilation and Execution

### Compiling the Java files:
To compile the Java files, use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
javac SortedLinkedList.java
javac SortedStack.java
