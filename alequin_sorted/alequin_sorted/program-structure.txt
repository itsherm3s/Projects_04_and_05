Imports:
The program imports necessary classes from the Java library:

Stack: To utilize the Stack data structure.
Scanner: To read user input.
InputMismatchException: To handle invalid input.
Main Method:
The main method executes the program:

It creates a Stack to store integers.
It uses a Scanner object to read user input.
The user is prompted to enter integers separated by spaces.
Input Handling:

The input line is read and split into tokens (individual numbers).
Each token is parsed into an integer and pushed onto the stack.
Sorting Logic:

A temporary Stack is created to hold the sorted numbers.
The program pops elements from the original stack and uses the temporary stack to sort them in ascending order.
Displaying the Sorted Stack:

The sorted stack is printed out, showing the numbers in order from smallest to largest.
Error Handling:

The program includes error handling for invalid inputs, displaying appropriate error messages when necessary.
Resource Management:

The scanner is closed at the end of the program to prevent resource leaks.
